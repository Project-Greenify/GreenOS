# GreenOS
GreenOS is an attempt to make the most
lightweight operating system ever, only
using the boot sector and leaving the
rest of the disk free! This means the
disk image compiles down to only 512
bytes, and to add to the lightweigt
feeling: there is NO implementations
of C or any other system language!
Just assembly!
# Build
You can compile the assembly file
into a disk image by using: ``make run_img``!
